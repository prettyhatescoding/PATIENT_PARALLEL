Dataset Overview
Purpose: Designed for binary and multi-class classification of brain tumors using MRI scans.

Classes:

Glioma (malignant tumor)

Meningioma (typically benign)

Pituitary (usually benign)

No tumor (healthy scans)

Key Features
Image Format: JPEG files organized into class-specific folders.

Size: ~3.2 GB total, with ~3,000+ images (varies slightly per class).

Resolution: Varies, but generally suitable for deep learning (e.g., 512x512 or similar).

Potential Use Cases
Binary Classification: Tumor vs. no tumor.

Multi-class Classification: Distinguishing between glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors.

Segmentation: Extending the dataset with masks for tumor localization (though masks arenâ€™t included in this version).

Limitations
Imbalance: Class distribution may not be uniform (common in medical datasets).

Metadata: Limited clinical details (e.g., patient age, scan parameters).

Preprocessing Needed: Resizing, normalization, or augmentation may be required.               and
